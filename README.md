NOTE

·         All the function libraries in our CBASE are already loaded into the tool (no need to add libraries)

·         All changes should now be made using the tool since changes made outside the tool will be overwritten by the tool.

·         We will now restrict users in directly deleting or modifying files in the CBASE libraries to avoid confusion and accidental deletions
